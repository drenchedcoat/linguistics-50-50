# linguistics-50-50
A simple and fun game consisting of a yes and a no, featuring your linguistics and hearing skills. Inspired by the game "The Great Language Game" and after finding out about the RiTa library for JavaScript, I decided to create this game as my final project for NYU Tandon DM6063 - Creative Coding.
